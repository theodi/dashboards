        Lunchtime Lectures at The ODI: Legislation as Data","description":"Friday
        Lunchtime Lectures at the Open Data Institute: 25 January 2013. For our third
        lecture... Legislation as Data\r\n\r\nLegislation affects us all. Many of
        our most important rights, duties and obligations are set out in statute law.
        What does it mean to think of legislation as data and how might open data
        thinking help lead us to good law?\r\n\r\n John Sheridan, Head of Legislation
        Services at The National Archives, guides us through legislation.gov.uk. Explaining
        what aspects of legislation can be represented as data and why the statute
        book can perhaps be better presented, understood and managed starting from
        a data perspective.\r\n\r\nThe slides for this lecture: http://www.scribd.com/doc/122989561/Friday-Lunchtime-Lectures-at-The-ODI-Legislation-as-Data
